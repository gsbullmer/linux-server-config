# linux-server-config
This is the fifth project in the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program. In this project, a Linux web server was created and configured.

There are two main parts:
- [Access the App](#access-the-app)
- [Setup the Server](#setup-the-server)

## Access the App
The web app can be viewed at: [http://ec2-52-32-196-18.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/][1.0]

Accessed the web app with the following credentials:
- **IP address**: 52.32.196.18
- **SSH port**: 2200
- **User**: grader

### Software Installed
The web server was configured with the following packages:

- fail2ban
- ntp
- apache2
- libapache2-mod-wsgi
- postgresql
- postgresql-contrib
- git
- python-flask
- python-flask-sqlalchemy
- python-psycopg2

### Third-Party Resources
I used the following resources to help set up the server correctly:
- [Server Config Walkthrough][3.0]
- [Automatic Security Updates][3.1]
- [Disable root login][3.2]
- [fail2ban][3.3]
- [fail2ban ufw Config][3.4]
- [NTP][3.5]
- [Deploy WSGI on Apache][3.6]
- [Deploy Flask app on aws ec2][3.7]
- [PostgreSQL][3.8]
- [Secure PostgreSQL on Ubuntu][3.9]

## Setup the Server
This step-by-step guide will walk you through the server setup
### Step 1
Launch your Virtual Machine with your Udacity account. Please note that upon graduation from the program your free Amazon AWS instance will no longer be available.

### Step 2
Follow the instructions provided to SSH into your server

### Step 3
Create a new user named grader

### Step 4
Give the grader the permission to sudo

### Step 5
Update all currently installed packages

### Step 6
Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200

### Step 7
Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123)

### Step 8
Configure the local timezone to UTC

### Step 9
Install and configure Apache to serve a Python mod_wsgi application

### Step 10
Install and configure PostgreSQL:
- Do not allow remote connections
- Create a new user named catalog that has limited permissions to your catalog application database

### Step 11
Install git, clone and setup your Catalog App project (from your GitHub repository from earlier in the Nanodegree program) so that it functions correctly when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser. Remember to set this up appropriately so that your .git directory is not publicly accessible via a browser!
