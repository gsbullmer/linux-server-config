# Linux Web Server Configuration

This is the fifth project in the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program. In this project, a Linux web server was created and configured.

There are two main parts:
- [Access the App](#access-the-app)
- [Setup the Server](#setup-the-server)

## Access the App
The web app can be viewed at: [http://ec2-52-32-196-18.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/][1.0]

Accessed the web app with the following credentials:
- **IP address**: 52.32.196.18
- **SSH port**: 2200
- **User**: grader

### Software Installed
The web server was configured with the following packages:

- fail2ban
- ntp
- apache2
- libapache2-mod-wsgi
- postgresql
- postgresql-contrib
- git
- python-flask
- python-flask-sqlalchemy
- python-psycopg2

### Third-Party Resources
I used the following resources to help set up the server correctly:
- [Server Config Walkthrough][3.0]
- [Automatic Security Updates][3.1]
- [Disable root login][3.2]
- [fail2ban][3.3]
- [fail2ban ufw Config][3.4]
- [NTP][3.5]
- [Deploy WSGI on Apache][3.6]
- [Deploy Flask app on aws ec2][3.7]
- [PostgreSQL][3.8]
- [Secure PostgreSQL on Ubuntu][3.9]

## Setup the Server
This step-by-step guide will walk you through the server setup

### The Virtual Machine
Udacity provided a virtual server through Amazon EC2.

### SSH
Use the udacity_key.rsa provided to log into the Udacity-provided AWS VM. To log into the AWS VM:
```bash
ssh root@52.32.196.18 -i ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa
```

### Create New User
Once logged in, create a new user called `grader`. To create this user, type:
```bash
adduser grader
```

Don't worry about giving the user user a strong password; passwords will be disabled in favor of SSH access. Fill out the user details if desired.

### Grant sudo Access
This new user needs `sudo` access. Type:

```bash
touch /etc/sudoers.d/grader
nano /etc/sudoers.d/grader
```

In this file, add the line:
```
grader ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

This will add the user `grader` as a sudoer without the need to provide a password.

### Configure SSH for New User
Next, add the ssh authorized key for the new user. Temporarily log in as the new user:
```bash
sudo -su grader
```

Create the `.ssh` directory and the `authorized_keys` file:
```bash
cd /home/grader
mkdir .ssh
touch .ssh/authorized_keys
nano .ssh/authorized_keys
```

Add this public key, which is paired with `udacity_key.rsa`:
```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDEmB6XaSRvn9MXwPw/FRHA5bVM4ex0hNfZDLq8xGX05HCmr4ErsWJ9/1EhnPEVeAnMhXwKDhAQ4iDxaVt/7tHa05vmRIbfL66uk2vjzt5Hsk5GvjD1bAQ23rTcmqbUQAjjF50+DngyN8NHNJde87K6qo33UyRMyJ3o+gkllaKd578I4qNSEJ92V2m6h3+k+dYVCKJiInZWGBix4zp3GDJmbzlDxgv+kJO5ExPPNeoq4ddKDtOzFYIun/iUUPSTpSnm1UiZreNvBsUT0xDtUX/iew4414VOyBD9ac2IdthSx0ujvLGPVHujSe1BA1PNmigo+KGHUtBwpfsyFQs9zTQr Udacity Student
```

Set the ssh file permissions:
```bash
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys
```

In a new terminal window, log in to `grader` with the rsa key:
```bash
ssh grader@52.32.196.18 -i ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa
```

**NOTE:** Be sure this can be done before logging out of `root`.

### Update Packages
Update all currently installed packages by typing:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

To allow automatic security updates, install the `unattended-upgrades` package, if not installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades
```

To enable unattended-upgrades, type:
```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority-low unattended-upgrades
```

### SSH Config
Change the SSH port from `22` to `2200`, remove root login, and force users to use key-based authentication only by modifying `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

#### Change SSH Port
Change the following line (extra lines removed for readablility):
```
# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for
Port 2200
```

#### Remove Root Login
Change the following line (extra lines removed for readablility):
```
# Authentication:
PermitRootLogin no
```

#### Force SSH Login
Change the following line (extra lines removed for readablility):
```
# Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
PasswordAuthentication no
```

#### Restart SSH Service
Restart the `ssh` service for the changes to take effect:
```bash
sudo service ssh restart
```
**NOTE:** Be sure to have the ability to log in to `grader` before logging out of `root`.

### Configure Firewall
Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123):
```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow 2200
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 123
sudo ufw enable
```

### Firewall Monitoring
Configure `fail2ban`, which will automatically block IP addresses that fail to correctly log in multiple times. First, install `fail2ban`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```

Next, configure a local copy of the `jail.conf`:
```bash
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Update the following section:
```
[ssh]

enabled  = true
banaction = ufw-ssh
port     = 2200
filter   = sshd
logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
```
This will enable the ssh jail, set the ban action to the new action `ufw-ssh` that will be defined below, listen on port `2200` instead of the default ssh port, and allows a max of `3` attempts to log in before the ban action triggering.

Next, create the `ufw-ssh` action referenced above:
```bash
sudo touch /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw-ssh.conf
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw-ssh.conf
```

Define the action as follows:
```
[Definition]
actionstart =
actionstop =
actioncheck =
actionban = ufw insert 1 deny from <ip> to any app OpenSSH
actionunban = ufw delete deny from <ip> to any app OpenSSH
```

Finally, restart `fail2ban`:
```bash
sudo service fail2ban restart
```

### Set Local Timezone
To set the system to use UTC, install `ntp`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ntp
```

### Apache2 and mod_wsgi
Install the Apache2 web server and wsgi module:
```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi
```

### PostgreSQL
Install and configure PostgreSQL:
```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
#### Create Users and Database
Login to postgreSQL as `postgres`:
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Next, create a new postgres user named `ibgdb_mod` without login privileges, and another postgres user named `ibgdb` with login privileges in the role `ibgdb_mod`:
```pgsql
CREATE ROLE ibgdb_mod;
CREATE ROLE ibgdb WITH LOGIN IN ROLE ibgdb_mod;
```

Now, create the `ibgdb` database, owned by `ibgdb_mod`:
```pgsql
CREATE DATABASE ibgdb OWNER ibgdb_mod;
```

#### Create Unix User

#### Disable Remote Login

### Deploy Web App
Install git, clone and setup your Catalog App project (from your GitHub repository from earlier in the Nanodegree program) so that it functions correctly when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser. Remember to set this up appropriately so that your .git directory is not publicly accessible via a browser!
